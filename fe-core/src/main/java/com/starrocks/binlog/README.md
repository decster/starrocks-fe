# StarRocks FE Binlog Package

The `com.starrocks.binlog` package is responsible for managing binary logs (binlogs) in the StarRocks Frontend (FE). Binlogs record data changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to StarRocks tables, enabling functionalities like Change Data Capture (CDC) and data replication to other systems.

Key responsibilities of this package include:

- **Binlog Management**: The `BinlogManager` class is the central component for managing binlog generation, tracking, and consumption. It handles enabling and disabling binlogs for tables and databases.
- **Configuration**: `BinlogConfig` holds configuration parameters related to binlog behavior, such as retention policies and storage details (though actual storage might be handled by underlying mechanisms).
- **Change Tracking**: Captures data modification events and serializes them into a binlog format.
- **CDC Support**: Provides the foundation for external tools or systems to consume these binlogs to replicate changes to other datastores or trigger downstream processes.

Key classes in this package include:
- `BinlogManager`: Manages the lifecycle and configuration of binlogs for tables. It allows enabling/disabling binlogs and retrieving binlog information.
- `BinlogConfig`: Represents the configuration settings for binlog functionality on a per-table basis, such as version and retention period.
