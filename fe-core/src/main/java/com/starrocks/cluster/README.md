# StarRocks FE Cluster Package

The `com.starrocks.cluster` package in the StarRocks Frontend (FE) is responsible for defining and managing metadata related to the StarRocks cluster itself, primarily from a logical or namespace perspective.

Key responsibilities of this package include:

- **Cluster Representation (Legacy)**:
  - `Cluster.java`: This class is deprecated. Historically, it might have represented a StarRocks cluster, holding information about its identity and associated databases. Current cluster node management is primarily handled by `com.starrocks.system.SystemInfoService` and overall state by `com.starrocks.server.GlobalStateMgr`.
- **Namespace Management**:
  - `ClusterNamespace`: Provides utilities for creating fully qualified names for entities like databases by prepending a cluster identifier (e.g., `default_cluster:db_name`). This helps in organizing database names and ensuring uniqueness, particularly in contexts where multiple clusters might be implicitly referenced or for specific naming conventions.

Key classes in this package include:
- `Cluster`: (Deprecated) A legacy class that once might have represented a StarRocks cluster.
- `ClusterNamespace`: Provides utilities for managing database namespaces within a cluster, including naming conventions and formatting.
- `BaseParam`: A utility class likely used for handling parameters or properties related to cluster entities or other operations.

While the `com.starrocks.system` package handles the physical nodes (backends, frontends, brokers) and their states, and `com.starrocks.server.GlobalStateMgr` manages the overall metadata including databases, the `com.starrocks.cluster` package historically focused on the logical organization and identity of the cluster, with `ClusterNamespace` being its primary active component for name qualification.
